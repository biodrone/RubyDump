AÂ LevelÂ DesignÂ TechnologyÂ studentsÂ haveÂ beenÂ inspiredÂ byÂ studyingÂ inÂ aÂ theÂ brandÂ newÂ SixthÂ FormÂ
CollegeÂ buildingÂ toÂ baseÂ theirÂ A2Â courseworkÂ onÂ creatingÂ similarÂ newÂ architecturalÂ Â designsÂ
TheÂ classÂ haveÂ workedÂ hardÂ overÂ theÂ lastÂ termÂ toÂ designÂ andÂ createÂ modelsÂ ofÂ newÂ buildingsÂ toÂ aÂ
specifiedÂ briefÂ Â
OnÂ ThursdayÂ theyÂ waitedÂ nervouslyÂ byÂ theirÂ modelsÂ awaitingÂ aÂ professionalÂ critiqueÂ ofÂ theirÂ workÂ
fromÂ aÂ localÂ architectÂ HannahÂ BarterÂ whoÂ currentlyÂ worksÂ forÂ UrbanÂ VisionÂ inÂ BurslemÂ
S52Â couldÂ beÂ mistakenÂ forÂ aÂ modelÂ villageÂ asÂ itÂ wasÂ filledÂ withÂ anÂ arrayÂ ofÂ tinyÂ buildingsÂ fromÂ aÂ newÂ

DuringÂ myÂ placementÂ IÂ designedÂ aÂ buildingÂ thatÂ wouldÂ fitÂ wellÂ intoÂ aÂ lakesideÂ environmentÂ IÂ choseÂ
carefullyÂ choseÂ theÂ materialsÂ toÂ includeÂ glassÂ andÂ woodenÂ panellingÂ soÂ theÂ houseÂ wouldÂ blendÂ wellÂ
withÂ itsÂ surroundingsÂ andÂ optedÂ forÂ aÂ butterflyÂ shapeÂ againÂ toÂ accentuateÂ theÂ themeÂ ofÂ natureÂ IÂ didÂ

WeÂ areÂ absolutelyÂ delightedÂ thatÂ oneÂ ofÂ ourÂ studentsÂ hasÂ wonÂ firstÂ prizeÂ inÂ aÂ
CambridgeÂ UniversityÂ essayÂ competitionÂ â€Â WellÂ doneÂ Torbenâ€Â
andÂ notÂ surprisinglyÂ ourÂ staffÂ andÂ studentsÂ atÂ theÂ collegeÂ shareÂ thisÂ sentimentÂ â€“Â whatÂ aÂ
tremendousÂ achievement!Â
CurrentÂ ASÂ studentÂ TorbenÂ SchwartzÂ isÂ nearingÂ theÂ endÂ ofÂ hisÂ firstÂ yearÂ atÂ theÂ collegeÂ studyingÂ MathsÂ FurtherÂ
MathsÂ PhilosophyÂ ReligiousÂ StudiesÂ andÂ MusicÂ TechnologyÂ andÂ alreadyÂ hasÂ hisÂ sightsÂ firmlyÂ setÂ onÂ enrollingÂ
asÂ anÂ undergraduateÂ atÂ CambridgeÂ UniversityÂ atÂ theÂ endÂ ofÂ hisÂ AÂ LevelÂ ProgrammeÂ
LastÂ weekÂ TorbenÂ heardÂ
theÂ newsÂ thatÂ hisÂ essayÂ hadÂ beenÂ selectedÂ byÂ theÂ judgingÂ panelÂ atÂ CorpusÂ ChristiÂ
CollegeÂ CambridgeÂ andÂ heÂ isÂ toÂ beÂ awardedÂ firstÂ prizeÂ inÂ theirÂ annualÂ PhilosophyÂ EssayÂ writingÂ competitionÂ
WhilstÂ researchingÂ universitiesÂ backÂ inÂ JanuaryÂ TorbenÂ cameÂ acrossÂ theÂ opportunityÂ toÂ enterÂ theÂ competitionÂ
andÂ wasÂ delightedÂ toÂ receiveÂ theÂ letterÂ lastÂ weekÂ invitingÂ himÂ toÂ anÂ OpenÂ DayÂ eventÂ atÂ CorpusÂ ChristiÂ CollegeÂ
toÂ collectÂ theÂ firstÂ prizeÂ
WhenÂ
IÂ
openedÂ
letterÂ
andÂ
sawÂ
whatÂ
itÂ
wasÂ
extremelyÂ
surprisedÂ
honouredÂ
thatÂ
judgingÂ
panelÂ
hadÂ
selectedÂ
myÂ
workÂ
notÂ
expectingÂ
toÂ
winÂ suchÂ aÂ prestigiousÂ awardÂ asÂ IÂ wasÂ notÂ sureÂ IÂ wasÂ writingÂ atÂ theÂ rightÂ levelÂ andÂ
didÂ
knowÂ

wouldÂ
beÂ
upÂ
againstÂ
MyÂ
collegeÂ
PhilosophyÂ teachersÂ ChrisÂ EyreÂ andÂ GeoffÂ WillisÂ bothÂ encouragedÂ meÂ toÂ enterÂ theÂ
competitionÂ andÂ IÂ amÂ gladÂ thatÂ theyÂ didÂ â€Â
EntrantsÂ toÂ theÂ competitionÂ wereÂ givenÂ theÂ choiceÂ ofÂ threeÂ essayÂ questionsÂ andÂ
TorbenÂ debatedÂ withÂ GeoffÂ aboutÂ whichÂ oneÂ heÂ shouldÂ tackleÂ Â
GeoffÂ WillisÂ wasÂ extremelyÂ proudÂ asÂ heÂ heardÂ theÂ newsÂ
ThisÂ isÂ aÂ nationalÂ competitionÂ whichÂ isÂ openÂ toÂ allÂ yearÂ 12Â
studentsÂ
acrossÂ
countryÂ
winÂ

AÂ COLLEGEÂ THATÂ PUTSÂ STUDENTSÂ Â
ATÂ THEÂ CENTREÂ
AtÂ theÂ SixthÂ FormÂ CollegeÂ weÂ placeÂ studentsÂ atÂ
theÂ centreÂ ofÂ everythingÂ weÂ doÂ
OurÂ MissionÂ StatementÂ isÂ
THEÂ YOUNGÂ PERSONâ€™SÂ COLLEGEÂ
DEVELOPINGÂ SKILLSÂ Â
INSPIRINGÂ EXCELLENCEâ€™Â
LearningÂ opportunitiesÂ areÂ wideÂ openÂ asÂ theÂ CollegeÂ offersÂ theÂ largestÂ numberÂ ofÂ AdvancedÂ
LevelÂ coursesÂ inÂ StaffordshireÂ
ThereÂ areÂ numerousÂ opportunitiesÂ forÂ studentsÂ toÂ becomeÂ involvedÂ inÂ theÂ collegeÂ
communityÂ fromÂ takingÂ partÂ inÂ SportÂ withÂ anÂ everÂ expandingÂ competitiveÂ sportsÂ andÂ
recreationalÂ funÂ offerÂ toÂ performingÂ atÂ majorÂ eventsÂ throughoutÂ theÂ yearÂ forÂ studentsÂ
interestedÂ inÂ theÂ performanceÂ artsÂ
ThereÂ wereÂ 84Â educationalÂ visitsÂ lastÂ yearÂ involvingÂ nearlyÂ 2400Â learnersÂ andÂ ourÂ studentsÂ
organisedÂ eventsÂ forÂ charityÂ whichÂ raisedÂ overÂ Â£1500Â
OurÂ StudentÂ VIPÂ andÂ PeerÂ MentorÂ programmesÂ areÂ openÂ toÂ allÂ studentsÂ givingÂ themÂ theÂ
opportunityÂ toÂ actÂ asÂ AmbassadorsÂ forÂ theÂ collegeÂ andÂ becomeÂ involvedÂ inÂ activitiesÂ inÂ theÂ
collegeÂ andÂ widerÂ communityÂ
OurÂ activeÂ StudentÂ ForumÂ andÂ StudentÂ CouncilÂ allowÂ learnersÂ toÂ becomeÂ involvedÂ inÂ
developmentsÂ withinÂ theÂ CollegeÂ â€“Â theyÂ areÂ ledÂ byÂ ourÂ twoÂ electedÂ StudentÂ GovernorsÂ
TheÂ â€œstudentÂ voiceâ€Â isÂ alwaysÂ welcomedÂ withÂ frequentÂ opportunitiesÂ forÂ studentsÂ toÂ
commentÂ onÂ theÂ CollegeÂ andÂ theirÂ learningÂ Â
WeÂ doÂ notÂ haveÂ lotsÂ ofÂ rulesÂ ourÂ onlyÂ oneÂ isÂ theÂ â€œCodeÂ ofÂ Conductâ€Â whichÂ isÂ displayedÂ inÂ allÂ
roomsÂ
CODEÂ OFÂ CONDUCTÂ
WeÂ aimÂ toÂ makeÂ theÂ SixthÂ FormÂ CollegeÂ aÂ friendlyÂ andÂ pleasantÂ environmentÂ inÂ whichÂ toÂ studyÂ
WeÂ thereforeÂ expectÂ youÂ toÂ treatÂ allÂ studentsÂ andÂ staffÂ withÂ courtesyÂ andÂ respectÂ andÂ theÂ CollegeÂ
buildingÂ andÂ equipmentÂ withÂ careÂ
ThankÂ youÂ
THEÂ TRANSITIONÂ FROMÂ SCHOOLÂ
CollegeÂ isÂ quiteÂ differentÂ fromÂ school!Â Â
ItÂ providesÂ anÂ experienceÂ forÂ learnersÂ whichÂ effectivelyÂ preparesÂ themÂ forÂ theÂ worldÂ ofÂ HigherÂ EducationÂ andÂ
employmentÂ
ThroughoutÂ theirÂ timeÂ hereÂ withÂ usÂ weÂ helpÂ ourÂ studentsÂ toÂ becomeÂ selfÂ motivatedÂ andÂ organisedÂ learnersÂ â€“Â
theyÂ learnÂ toÂ useÂ freeÂ timeÂ inÂ theÂ dayÂ creativelyÂ
TheÂ
providesÂ

theÂ countryÂ andÂ wereÂ intriguedÂ toÂ discoverÂ whatÂ wasÂ inÂ storeÂ forÂ themÂ forÂ theÂ nextÂ threeÂ yearsÂ
RoseÂ LaneÂ CourseÂ LeaderÂ forÂ DesignÂ atÂ theÂ collegeÂ tookÂ theÂ studentsÂ alongÂ toÂ theÂ masterÂ classesÂ toÂ giveÂ themÂ
allÂ anÂ insightÂ intoÂ whatÂ undergraduateÂ studyÂ canÂ beÂ likeÂ
OurÂ studentsÂ wereÂ reallyÂ positiveÂ aboutÂ theÂ masterÂ classesÂ andÂ theyÂ allÂ reallyÂ enjoyedÂ theÂ practicalÂ elementsÂ toÂ
theÂ sessionsÂ Â TheÂ experienceÂ evenÂ changedÂ someÂ ofÂ theirÂ mindsÂ aboutÂ attendingÂ universityÂ andÂ itÂ gaveÂ themÂ aÂ
chanceÂ toÂ exploreÂ newÂ waysÂ ofÂ workingÂ promptingÂ themÂ allÂ toÂ lookÂ intoÂ degreeÂ coursesÂ thatÂ theyÂ initiallyÂ didnâ€™tÂ

AÂ COLLEGEÂ THATÂ PUTSÂ STUDENTSÂ Â
ATÂ THEÂ CENTREÂ
AtÂ theÂ SixthÂ FormÂ CollegeÂ weÂ placeÂ studentsÂ atÂ
theÂ centreÂ ofÂ everythingÂ weÂ doÂ
OurÂ MissionÂ StatementÂ isÂ
THEÂ YOUNGÂ PERSONâ€™SÂ COLLEGEÂ
DEVELOPINGÂ SKILLSÂ Â
INSPIRINGÂ EXCELLENCEâ€™Â
LearningÂ opportunitiesÂ areÂ wideÂ openÂ asÂ theÂ CollegeÂ offersÂ theÂ largestÂ numberÂ ofÂ AdvancedÂ
LevelÂ coursesÂ inÂ StaffordshireÂ
ThereÂ areÂ numerousÂ opportunitiesÂ forÂ studentsÂ toÂ becomeÂ involvedÂ inÂ theÂ collegeÂ
communityÂ fromÂ takingÂ partÂ inÂ SportÂ withÂ anÂ everÂ expandingÂ competitiveÂ sportsÂ andÂ
recreationalÂ funÂ offerÂ toÂ performingÂ atÂ majorÂ eventsÂ throughoutÂ theÂ yearÂ forÂ studentsÂ
interestedÂ inÂ theÂ performanceÂ artsÂ
ThereÂ wereÂ 84Â educationalÂ visitsÂ lastÂ yearÂ involvingÂ nearlyÂ 2400Â learnersÂ andÂ ourÂ studentsÂ
organisedÂ eventsÂ forÂ charityÂ whichÂ raisedÂ overÂ Â£1500Â
OurÂ StudentÂ VIPÂ andÂ PeerÂ MentorÂ programmesÂ areÂ openÂ toÂ allÂ studentsÂ givingÂ themÂ theÂ
opportunityÂ toÂ actÂ asÂ AmbassadorsÂ forÂ theÂ collegeÂ andÂ becomeÂ involvedÂ inÂ activitiesÂ inÂ theÂ
collegeÂ andÂ widerÂ communityÂ
OurÂ activeÂ StudentÂ ForumÂ andÂ StudentÂ CouncilÂ allowÂ learnersÂ toÂ becomeÂ involvedÂ inÂ
developmentsÂ withinÂ theÂ CollegeÂ â€“Â theyÂ areÂ ledÂ byÂ ourÂ twoÂ electedÂ StudentÂ GovernorsÂ
TheÂ â€œstudentÂ voiceâ€Â isÂ alwaysÂ welcomedÂ withÂ frequentÂ opportunitiesÂ forÂ studentsÂ toÂ
commentÂ onÂ theÂ CollegeÂ andÂ theirÂ learningÂ Â
WeÂ doÂ notÂ haveÂ lotsÂ ofÂ rulesÂ ourÂ onlyÂ oneÂ isÂ theÂ â€œCodeÂ ofÂ Conductâ€Â whichÂ isÂ displayedÂ inÂ allÂ
roomsÂ
CODEÂ OFÂ CONDUCTÂ
WeÂ aimÂ toÂ makeÂ theÂ SixthÂ FormÂ CollegeÂ aÂ friendlyÂ andÂ pleasantÂ environmentÂ inÂ whichÂ toÂ studyÂ
WeÂ thereforeÂ expectÂ youÂ toÂ treatÂ allÂ studentsÂ andÂ staffÂ withÂ courtesyÂ andÂ respectÂ andÂ theÂ CollegeÂ
buildingÂ andÂ equipmentÂ withÂ careÂ
ThankÂ youÂ
THEÂ TRANSITIONÂ FROMÂ SCHOOLÂ
CollegeÂ isÂ quiteÂ differentÂ fromÂ school!Â Â
ItÂ providesÂ anÂ experienceÂ forÂ learnersÂ whichÂ effectivelyÂ preparesÂ themÂ forÂ theÂ worldÂ ofÂ HigherÂ EducationÂ andÂ
employmentÂ
ThroughoutÂ theirÂ timeÂ hereÂ withÂ usÂ weÂ helpÂ ourÂ studentsÂ toÂ becomeÂ selfÂ motivatedÂ andÂ organisedÂ learnersÂ â€“Â
theyÂ learnÂ toÂ useÂ freeÂ timeÂ inÂ theÂ dayÂ creativelyÂ
