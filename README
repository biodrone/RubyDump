This is a project with some random files written by me to experiment with the Ruby language. There may be some diamonds but it is mostly unusable rough. You may use these files however you like, the ones with a function, such as the wordlist generator, will be updated sem-regularly (when I come up with some new functionality...)
You can email me if you want to suggest any features or neat little tricks that I am missing that will make my project(s) better in any way. Reach me at:

Thank you,
